<h2>there are 3 basic types of elements in html</h2>

1. **block element** = take's up the entire line. forced to be on thier own line. take's up the entire line in the container.
2. **inline-block element** = only takes up space as much as they need to. (img, input)
3. **inline element** = text element, appear within a line of text.

**display** property can be used to switch between these elements.
